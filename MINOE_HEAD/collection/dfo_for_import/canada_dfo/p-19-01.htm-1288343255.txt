PART II
ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTED NATURAL
AREAS

Establishment of protected natural areas
_5_(_1_)On the recommendation of the Minister, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
may, by regulation,
(a)establish a protected natural area on Crown Lands for the purpose of this
Act, or
(b)establish, subject to any terms and conditions of the written consent
referred to in subsection¬ (4), a protected natural area on private lands for
the purpose of this Act.
_5_(_2_)A protected natural area established under subsection¬ (1) may be a Class I
Protected Natural Area or a Class II Protected Natural Area.
_5_(_3_)Before the Lieutenant-Governor in Council establishes a protected natural
area on Crown Lands, the Minister shall
(a)in the case of a protected natural area that is 750¬ hectares or less,
undertake such consultation as the Minister considers appropriate, or
(b)in the case of a protected natural area that is greater than 750¬ hectares,
undertake consultations in accordance with the regulations.
_5_(_4_)Before the Lieutenant-Governor in Council establishes a protected natural
area on private lands, the Minister shall obtain the written consent to the
establishment of the private lands as a protected natural area from every
person who has a proprietary, possessory or security interest in the private
lands.
_5_(_5_)A written consent referred to in subsection¬ (4) may be for a fixed term or
for perpetuity, and every person with a proprietary, possessory or security
interest in the same private lands shall consent for the same term.
_5_(_6_)Where the written consent to the establishment of private lands as a
protected natural area is given by every person with a proprietary, possessory
or security interest in the private lands, a copy of the consent shall be filed
in the land registration office in the county or counties in which the lands
are situated, and the consent, subject to its terms and conditions, is binding
for the term of the consent on every person with a proprietary, possessory or
security interest in the lands and any subsequent person with any such interest
in the lands.
_5_(_7_)No action or other proceeding lies or shall be instituted against the
Minister or the Crown by reason only that the Minister failed to obtain the
written consent of a person under subsection¬ (4) if the Minister for any bona
fide reason failed to identify that person as having a proprietary, possessory
or security interest in the private lands.
_5_(_8_)The failure of the Minister to obtain the written consent of every person
who has a proprietary, possessory or security interest in private lands does
not affect the validity of any regulation establishing a protected natural area
on the private lands.

Alteration of the boundaries of or abolishment of protected natural areas on
Crown Lands
_6_(_1_)On the recommendation of the Minister, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
may, by regulation,
(a)alter the boundaries of a protected natural area on Crown Lands, or
(b)abolish a protected natural area on Crown Lands, if the lands are no longer
suitable for the purpose of this Act.
_6_(_2_)Before the Lieutenant-Governor in Council alters the boundaries of a
protected natural area on Crown Lands, the Minister shall undertake such
consultations as the Minister considers appropriate.
_6_(_3_)Before the Lieutenant-Governor in Council abolishes a protected natural
area on Crown Lands, the Minister shall
(a)in the case of a protected natural area that is 750¬ hectares or less,
undertake such consultation as the Minister considers appropriate, or
(b)in the case of a protected natural area that is greater than 750¬ hectares,
undertake consultations in accordance with the regulations.

Alteration of the boundaries of or abolishment of protected natural areas on
private lands
_7_(_1_)On the recommendation of the Minister, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council
may, by regulation,
(a)alter the boundaries of a protected natural area on private lands so as to
remove a portion of the private lands from the protected natural area, or
(b)abolish a protected natural area on private lands, if the lands are no
longer suitable for the purpose of this Act.
_7_(_2_)Before the Lieutenant-Governor in Council alters the boundaries of a
protected natural area on private lands so as to remove a portion of the
private lands from the protected natural area or abolishes a protected natural
area on private lands, the Minister shall serve notice in writing of the
intention to remove the portion of the private lands or to abolish the
protected natural area on private lands to the owner or owners of the private
lands.
_7_(_3_)The failure of the Minister to serve notice under subsection¬ (2) to the
owner or owners of the private lands does not affect the validity of any
regulation altering the boundaries of or abolishing a protected natural area on
private lands.

Filing of descriptions or plans of protected natural areas and publication or
filing of notice
_8_(_1_)Where a protected natural area is established, its boundaries are altered
or a protected natural area is abolished, the Minister shall without delay
