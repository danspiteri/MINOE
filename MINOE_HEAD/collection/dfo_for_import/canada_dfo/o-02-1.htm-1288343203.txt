(b)designate a pool by describing the surface area vertically above the pool,
and by naming the geological formation and the zone in which the pool occurs;
(c)determine whether a field or pool as described under paragraphÂ (a) or (b)
is to be operated for the production of oil or natural gas, or both;
(d)designate the area that is to be allocated to a well in connection with
fixing allowable production;
(e)control and regulate the production of oil, natural gas, and water by
restriction, proration, or prohibition;
(f)require the disposal into an underground formation or otherwise, in
accordance with such terms and conditions as he prescribes, of any water
produced;
(g)prescribe the conditions under which drilling operations are to be carried
out in a water-covered area, and any special measure to be taken in such
operations;
(g.1)determine special spacing areas;
(h)prescribe other than a normal spacing area in any field, pool, or other
area; and
(i)prescribe what constitutes paying quantity with respect to any well drilled
within the Province.
1984, c.53, s.5; 2001, c.20, s.28.

37The Minister may restrict the amount of oil or natural gas, or both, that may
be produced in the Province by
(a)fixing a Provincial allowable rate of production for oil not exceeding the
market demand as determined by the Minister,
(b)allocating the Provincial allowable rate of production for oil in a
reasonable manner among the producing pools in the Province by fixing the
amount of oil that may be produced from each pool without waste to meet the
Provincial allowable rate of production so determined,
(c)distributing the portion of the Provincial allowable rate of production
allocated to a pool among the wells in the pool in such a manner that each
lessee is to produce or receive his fair share of the oil in the pool, and
(d)limiting the total amount of natural gas that may be produced from any pool
without waste, having regard to the market demand for natural gas, as
determined by him, to an amount required for the efficient use of natural gas
for the production of oil and for the efficient utilization of the natural gas
reserve of the Province.
1984, c.53, s.6.

38In order to prevent waste, the Minister may
(a)require the repressuring, recycling, or pressure maintenance of any pool or
portion thereof, and for or incidental to that purpose require the introduction
or injection into any pool or portion thereof of natural gas, air, water, or
other substance, and
(b)require that any natural gas be gathered and processed if necessary, and
that the natural gas or liquid hydrocarbon extracted therefrom be marketed or
injected into an underground reservoir for storage or for any other purpose.

39No person shall proceed with a scheme for
(a)repressuring, recycling, or pressure maintenance in any field or pool,
(b)the processing, storage, or disposal of natural gas, or
(c)the gathering, storage and disposal of water produced from any field or
pool,
unless the Minister, by order, has approved the scheme upon the terms and
conditions the Minister prescribes.
1990, c.61, s.96.
PREVENTION OF LOSS OR DAMAGE

40If at any time an escape of oil or natural gas from a well is not prevented
or if a flow of water is not controlled, the Minister may take such means as
appear to him to be necessary or expedient in the public interest to control
and prevent the escape of oil, natural gas, or water.

41(1)Where the Minister is satisfied, after an inquiry held upon notice given
to such persons as he deems proper, that a well is being operated in such a
manner that any provision of this Act or the regulations is contravened or not
complied with, he may order that on and after a date to be fixed by him no
production is to be permitted from the well and that it is to be shut in and
kept shut in until such time as he directs to the contrary.
41(2)Where, in the opinion of the Minister, waste, damage to property, or
pollution can be prevented, he may direct that a well be shut down pending an
inquiry under subsectionÂ (1), which shall be held within fifteen days of the
making of the direction.
41(3)Where it appears to the Minister that a method or practice being employed
in any drilling, completion, suspension, abandonment, or production operation
is in any way inadequate, improper or hazardous, he may direct orally,
confirmed by a note in the daily drilling report, that the operation be
discontinued until methods approved by him are adopted.

42(1)Where the Minister is of the opinion that, because of hazardous conditions
in a field or at a well, it is necessary or expedient to close any area and to
shut out therefrom all persons except those that are specifically authorized by
him, he may designate in writing the area to be closed prohibiting anyone from
entering, travelling about, or remaining therein without a travel permit issued
under his authority.
42(2)The Minister may provide for such notice as is practicable under the
circumstances, and may cause the notice setting out the area to be closed to be
published as in his opinion gives adequate publicity.
42(3)In addition to the notice provided by subsectionÂ (2), the Minister shall
advise an appropriate representative of the Minister of Transport of Canada of
his action under this section.

43(1)Without restricting the generality of sectionÂ 42, if in the opinion of
the Minister, the control of a well or any completion, suspension, or
abandonment is not in accordance with a direction, or requirement of the
Minister, he, or any person duly authorized by him, shall have access to and
may enter upon the well site or any structure thereon and do whatever the
Minister deems necessary because of the failure to comply with the direction or
requirement.
43(2)The Minister of Finance may use or expend all or any part of a security
deposit furnished by the well licensee to defray the cost of, as determined by
the Minister, or the cost incidental to the work of control, completion,
suspension, or abandonment of the well to the satisfaction of the Minister.
43(3)The return of the deposit or any part thereof, does not relieve the well
licensee of liability for any cost of or the cost incidental to the control,
completion, suspension or abandonment of a well and does not reduce his
liability for such cost.
43(4)The cost incurred by the Minister under this section remaining unpaid
after applying thereto the security deposit of the well licensee held by the
Minister of Finance is a debt payable by the well licensee to the Crown.

44(1)The Minister, for the enforcement of any direction or requirement
prescribed by him under sections 42 and 43 may
(a)take such steps and employ such persons as he considers necessary,
(b)forcibly or otherwise enter upon, seize, and take possession of any well,
together with the whole or part of the movable and immovable property in, on,
or about the well or used in connection therewith or appertaining thereto
together with any of the records pertinent thereto,
(c)either discontinue all production or take over the management and control of
it,
(d)plug the well at any depth, and
(e)take such steps as he considers necessary to prevent the flow of or escape
of oil, natural gas, or water from any stratum that the well enters.
44(2)Upon the Minister taking possession of a well and as long as such
possession continues, every officer and employee of the well licensee, his
agent, or contractor shall obey the directions or requirements concerning the
well given by the Minister, or by such person placed in charge or control of
the well by the Minister.
44(3)Upon possession being taken of any well, the Minister may take, deal with,
and dispose of all oil and natural gas produced at the well as if it were the
property of the Crown, subject to the payment of the net proceeds thereof as
provided in this section.
44(4)The costs and expenses of, and the costs and expenses incidental to, a
proceeding taken by the Minister under this section are at the discretion of
the Minister, and he may direct by whom, to whom, and to what extent they are
to be paid.
44(5)Without restricting the generality of the foregoing subsections, the
Minister may pay, from the proceeds of the oil and natural gas produced at the
well
(a)all costs and expenses incidental to the proceedings taken by the Minister
under this section, including the costs and expenses of the management,
operation, and control of the well by the Minister, and
(b)all costs and expenses of carrying out investigations and conservation
measures that the Minister deems necessary in connection with the well.
44(6)The net proceeds of the oil and natural gas produced at the well remaining
after the payment of the costs and expenses under subsectionÂ (5) shall be paid
by the Minister into The Court of Queenâ€™s Bench of New Brunswick in
accordance with the Rules of The Court of Queenâ€™s Bench of New Brunswick
under the Judicature Act.
44(7)If the proceeds of the oil and natural gas produced at the well are not
sufficient to pay all costs and expenses of, or incidental to, a proceeding,
investigation, or measure taken, and the Minister directs that the balance of
the costs and expenses or any part thereof are to be paid by the well licensee,
then the provisions of sectionÂ 43 regarding the use of the security deposit
and regarding the further liability of the well licensee with respect to the
costs referred to in that section apply, mutatis mutandis, to the use of such
security deposit, and to the further liability of the well licensee, to defray
the balance of the costs and expenses that are incurred under this section.
1979, c.41, s.89.
SAVINGS

45The inclusion in a licence to search or a lease of oil or natural gas that
does not belong to or is not reserved to the Crown in right of the Province
does not invalidate such licence to search or lease with respect to the
remainder of the licence to search or lease.
1984, c.53, s.7.
UNIT AGREEMENT

46The Minister may enter into a unitization agreement for the unitized
operation of a field or pool or any part thereof, and upon the execution of

record the transfer, assignment, agreement, or instrument is received by the
Minister.
48(4)Failure to record a transfer, assignment, agreement or instrument
affecting the title to a licence to search or a lease does not invalidate the
transfer, assignment, agreement, or instrument as between the parties thereto,
but subsectionÂ (2) governs the effectiveness thereof with respect to another
person.
48(5)No transfer, assignment, agreement, or instrument affecting title to a
licence to search or a lease is to be recorded unless it is accompanied by the
