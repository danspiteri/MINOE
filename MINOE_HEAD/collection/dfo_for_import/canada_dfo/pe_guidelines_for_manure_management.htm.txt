php3?number=70587</=E> / GUIDELINES FOR MANURE MANAGEMENT FOR PRINCE EDWARD
ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / 1. Introduction The "Manure Management Guidelines in
Prince Edward Island" gives direction for recommended manure management
practices as well as serving as a guideline for anyone concerned with the
establishment and operation of new livestock confinement facilities, expansion
of existing livestock facilities or changes in land use in the rural area. It
is the successor to the /Draft 1986 Guidelines for Manure Management and
Separation Distances in P.E.I./ In order to reduce the potential for
environmental problems involving livestock agriculture, the concept of Minimum
Separation Distance (MSD) between livestock facilities and other non-compatible
land uses is included as a major component of the guidelines. The guidelines
are intended to compliment programs and statutory requirements under the
Environment Protection Act, Public Health Act, Fisheries Act and other Acts
that relate to agricultural use and the development of land and the enforcement
of environmental quality. These Guidelines utilize a two-part approach to
promote proper land use siting and livestock manure management. It is intended
that livestock farming operations have sufficient land base available for the
recycling of manure nutrients as well as provide reasonable separation
distances between the livestock operation and neighbours to reduce nuisance
conflicts. The guidelines encourage environmental sustainability by emphasizing
the recycling of manure on land through the adoption of management techniques
that promote the removal of manure nutrients by the crops grown. The guidelines
also provide practical information to assist producers in further reducing
environmental problems. *1.1 Current Concerns* The agricultural community and
rural residents generally acknowledge that even with the best management, there
are odours associated with livestock production. The increasing size and number
of livestock operations in conjunction with expanded residential land use in
the rural areas has greatly increased the potential for environmental conflicts
between non-compatible land uses. Both government and livestock producers are
concerned about nuisance odours and the water pollution potential associated
with the storage and utilization of livestock manures. *1.2 Purpose of the
Guidelines* These guidelines describe manure management systems and practices
which will reduce the risk of pollution and minimize odours. The purpose of
these guidelines are: * to assist livestock producers in their efforts to
prevent pollution and minimize odour * to provide a standard which may be used
in determining normal, acceptable farming practices * to provide information to
the general public and officials who want to evaluate livestock, operations for
their potential effects on the environment and surrounding land uses. * to
provide government with a basis for evaluation of livestock operations *1.3 The
Intended User* The Manure Management Guidelines are intended to be used by all
livestock producers, provincial and municipal officials, land use planners,
residential developers, owners of recreation areas and the general public who
are concerned with the siting, design and management of expanding and new
livestock facilities, or the management of existing facilities. Producers
planning new livestock facilities or changes in existing operations are
encouraged to develop a farmstead operation and management plan based on the
Guidelines. The Guidelines can also assist producers and the livestock industry
in improving manure management strategies. *1.4 Overview of Permits and
Approvals Process* *1.4.1 Development/Building Permits* All new livestock
developments, expansions or modification of existing livestock operations,
change of use of buildings for livestock housing and construction of manure
storage facilities may require a development/building permit from the authority
having jurisdiction in accordance with the Planning Act Regulations or the
municipality's regulations. *Note*: Where a project requires environmental
approval and/or an entrance way permit, the building permit will not be issued
until the approval and/or the entrance permit is issued. The fees for the
Development Permit may vary depending on the location, size and type of the
farm structure. The applicant should allow six to eight weeks for a decision on
the building permit application. *1.4.2 Entrance Way Permit (if applicable)*
All new development along an arterial highway and/or a seasonal road requires
and Entrance Way Permit in accordance with the Roads Act, Highway Access
Regulations. There is an application fee. For proposals located in
municipalities with official plans and by-laws application must be made to the
Department of Transportation & Public Works
www.gov.pe.ca/tpw/index.php3>. For proposals that are not located in
municipalities application must be made to the Department of Community Services
& Attorney General at the nearest Regional Services Center. If a highway access
culvert is required and/or to be relocated, there is a fee. *1.4.3 Sewage
Disposal Permit (if applicable)* A sewage disposal permit is required for any
construction, reconstruction or installation of a sewage disposal system for
the collection and treatment of human waste and/or milk parlor waste water in
accordance with the Sewage Disposal Regulations, Environmental Protection Act.
The licensed sewage contractor makes application to the Department of Community
Services & Attorney General for a permit. There is a permit fee. *1.4.4 Water
Well Permit (if applicable)* A well permit is required for high capacity wells
and/or for wells which are constructed or located in areas which vary from the
provisions of the Water Well Regulations, Environmental Protection Act.
Application is made to the Groundwater Section of the Department of Technology
& Environment. *1.4.5 Plumbing/Electrical Permits* All plumbing and electrical
work require a permit in accordance with provincial regulations. For further
information on fees, consult the Department of Community Services & Attorney
General at the nearest Regional Services Center. *1.4.6 Environmental Approval*
New commercial livestock operations and significant livestock expansions to
existing livestock operations require an approval pursuant to Section 9 of the
Environmental Protection Act. There is no application fee. *Published jointly

ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / Background These *"Manure Management Guidelines for
Prince Edward Island"* recognize the importance of the livestock industry to
the social and economic well-being of Prince Edward Island. The guidelines
support the principle that livestock operations have an important role to play
in Island society and hence have a right to establish, operate and expand in
accordance with reasonable and acceptable standards. These guidelines consider
the needs and concerns of all residents of Prince Edward Island to ensure that
they can continue to enjoy a good quality of life. At the same time, the
guidelines recognize the importance of the long-term sustainability and
protection of the Province's natural land, air and water resources. They are a
key element toward our goal of ensuring sustainable resource land use on Prince
Edward Island. The assistance and participation of all groups and individuals
who were involved in the development of these guidelines is gratefully
acknowledged. These guidelines come into effect on January 7, 1999. Last

ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / 3. Manure Management *3.1 Introduction* Sections 3, 4
and 5 deal with many of the management factors that must be considered when
handling, storing and using livestock manure. Section 3 describes the different
types of manure, and the importance of the proper utilization of manure.
Section 4 deals with the storage of manure and Section 5 deals with the land
application of manure. General farmstead appearance can have a bearing on the
attitude of the community. Visual screening of manure storages has positive
results. Good sanitation and fly control around buildings and manure storages
are important. Maintaining good public relations with neighbours and the
community at large is important in avoiding conflicts. Consideration of
neighbours is an important aspect of manure management. Manure should be stored
and spread in such a way as to be of the most value as a fertilizer, cause the
least inconvenience to neighbours and minimize the potential for causing
environmental problems. Locating buildings and manure storages in accordance
with Minimum Separation Distance recommendations will significantly reduce the
detection of odours off-property. (See Section 7
php3?number=73112#7>) *3.2 Manure Types* Manure is a valuable by-product of a
livestock operation. It provides a source of crop nutrients and organic matter,
valuable in sustaining soil productivity. The physical characteristics of
manure may be described according to its solids content. Manure may be handled
as a liquid, slurry or semi-solid and as a solid. * *Liquid* manure is produced
when little or no bedding is used. It contains less than 5 percent solids. The
manure, as excreted, typically has a solids content from 9 to 12 percent. The
additional liquid comes from washing floors and equipment and spillage from
waterers. * *Semi-solid (Slurry)* manure contains from 5 to 20 percent solids.
* *Solid* manure has sufficient bedding added so it is stackable. It contains a
solids content greater than 20 percent. To produce a solid, the liquid is
drained off or absorbed into the bedding material. *3.3 Manure as a Fertilizer*
Several major benefits are associated with the proper management of livestock
manure. Manure is a valuable organic source of crop nutrients, particularly
nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, and several secondary micro-nutrients.
When recycled to the land, manure reduces the need to purchase commercial
fertilizers. Soil quality improves with added organic matter. Please refer to
Section 5
php3?number=73079#5top> for more information on land application of manure.
When considering manure as a fertilizer the important characteristics are: *
nitrogen content; * phosphorus content; * potassium and sulphur content; *
organic matter content, and * micro-organisms *3.3.1 Nitrogen*: The nitrogen in
manure exists in two forms, organic nitrogen which forms the largest portion,
and ammonium nitrogen. Organic nitrogen is not available for use by plants
until it mineralizes to the nitrate form, the same form as the nitrogen in some
commercial fertilizers. The rate of mineralization will depend upon the
composition of the manure, soil type, temperature and moisture content.
Generally, 30 to 50 percent of the nitrogen will be mineralized during the
first cropping season with the balance mineralized during the next three years.
As the soil warms in spring, the nitrogen undergoes a conversion from the
ammonia form to the nitrate form. Nitrate-nitrogen is dissolved in water and
can move away from the root zone in the soil. This process is known as
leaching. When manure is handled and spread on land, some of the nitrogen in
the manure will be released to the atmosphere as ammonia gas. Typical nitrogen
losses for various methods of spreading are listed in Appendix C
php3?number=70597#c>. To maximize the fertilizer value, manure must be stored
and handled to reduce nitrogen losses. Nitrogen can be conserved by using the
following practices: * transfer the manure from the barn to storage as often as
possible, especially during the summer; * use transfer systems such as bottom
loading storages that minimize contact between the manure and the air; * use
storage facilities with a minimum of exposed surface area, or cover the manure
storage to reduce contact with air; and * when spreading, minimize exposure
time by incorporating the manure into the soil as quickly as possible. Most
nitrogen losses occur within the first 24 hours after the manure is spread.
*3.3.2 Phosphorous*: The phosphorus in manure exists in both the organic and
inorganic forms, but unlike nitrogen, phosphorus is not released to the air. As
with nitrogen, the inorganic form is readily available to be used by plants,
but the organic form is not available until the phosphorus is mineralized.
Phosphorus is not leached from the root zone unless very high levels build up
in the soil. Surface waters can be polluted if runoff occurs from fields where
the manure has not been incorporated. *3.3.3 Micro-organisms*: Manure contains
large numbers of micro-organisms. The micro-organisms that carry or cause
diseases are known as pathogens. The easiest transfer of pathogens from animals
to people is through direct contact. Consumption of contaminated products which
are uncooked, such as vegetables irrigated with manure is one example. The
potential for disease transmission is reduced when pathogens are rapidly
destroyed by drying and exposure to sunlight. Disease transmission risk is also
largely reduced when manure is incorporated into soil. *3.3.4 Organic Matter*:
The application of manure to crop land can help maintain soil organic material,
improve soil tilth and control soil erosion. When fields are cropped, a portion
of the organic matter is removed from the field. The use of commercial
inorganic fertilizers does not replenish the lost organic material. Depending
on the soil type, a steady depletion of soil organic matter can result in a
soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion. Repeated long-term
application of manure at reasonable rates will improve the soil condition and
water-holding characteristics as a result of the regular addition of organic
matter. *Published jointly by:* P.E.I. Department of Agriculture and Forestry

recommended for manure application due to excessive odour production and high
nitrogen loss. * Manure should not be spread during the period of June 20 to
September 8 unless it is absolutely necessary. * During the period of June 20
to September 8, manure should only be applied for the fertilization of hay,
pasture land, summer fallow land or to establish cover crops. * Manure applied
to summer fallow and for establishing cover crops should be incorporated within
48 hours. *Manure Spreading {5.3} {5.3.1} {5.3.6}* * Minimum setback distances
for manure spreading are recommended in Table 3
php3?number=73079#table3> . * The slope of the land should be considered when
spreading manure. * Sloping land should be maintained with a reasonable amount
of crop cover to provide protection against manure runoff. * Winter application
is not recommended because of the high potential for runoff and surface water
pollution as well as high nutrient losses due to these factors. *Soil and Crop
Implications {5.4.2.}* * Manure should not be applied to soil that has a
moisture content greater than its field moisture holding capacity.
*Environmental Impact Assessment Process (EIA) {6.3}* * New commercial
livestock operations and significant livestock expansions to existing livestock
operations require an approval pursuant to Section 9 of the Environmental
Protection Act. There is no application fee. *Minimum Separation Distance (MSD)
{7.1} {7.2}* * All *new livestock operations* should comply with the Minimum
Separation Distance recommendations in Section 7 of the Manure Management
Guidelines document. * As a general rule where the majority of residents and
businesses within the minimum separation distance (MSD) are in agreement with
the *new livestock operation*, the MSD requirements could be varied. * Where
residences and businesses currently exist within the minimum separation
distance of *an expanding livestock operation*, the owner of that operation can
expect to receive approval to expand provided the operation complies with these
guidelines and other relevant land use and environmental protection
legislation. The views of residents and businesses that are within the MSD of
an expanding farm operation will be given due consideration during the review
process. * The Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> will be consulted and provide recommendations on
development/building permit applications involving commercial livestock
operations. *Implementation of Minimum Separation Distance (MSD) {7.3}* * The
applicant completes the MSD Data Sheet and Sketch Sheet and submits them to the
appropriate building permit office (municipal or Provincial government) for
determination of separation distances and to initiate the building permit
process. * MSD applies when an application is made for a new livestock facility
or change of use of a livestock facility. * MSD applies only to livestock and
poultry facilities. * The direction of the prevailing winds, the presence of
berms or other forms of screening do not affect the calculated MSD. * Variances
to the MSD may be considered based on site specific circumstances. * Minimum
Separation Distance may be reduced by 25% if prevailing summer winds are
favorable to reducing odour nuisance. * Municipal and Provincial officials must
consult P.E.I. Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> staff when considering a variance application.
Conditions that meet the intent, if not the precise distance of MSD, or that
mitigate environmental impacts, will receive further consideration. Such
conditions may include unique topography and/or micro-climate which mitigate
nuisance, visual screening, and unique management/technology. * Distance to the
neighbouring buildings is measured as the shortest distance between that
portion of the assessed barn used for livestock housing or the manure storage
and the building. *Published jointly by: * P.E.I. Department of Agriculture and

ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / 4. MANURE STORAGE
php3?number=70799</=E> / Composting, Safety & Odour Control *4.12 Field Manure
Piles* The field storage of solid manure without effluent containment on a soil
base may be permitted under the following conditions: * The manure pile should
be located on a suitable site which will reduce the potential for surface water
and groundwater contamination. * The manure pile should maintain minimum
separation distances of 300 m (984 ft) to a public water source, 90 m (300
ft)from all watercourses, lakes, ponds, natural wetlands, residence(s),
residential wells and the manure pile should be placed to avoid runoff into
public road ditches. * The manure pile should not be located in areas where
there is accumulated runoff or areas that are subject to water ponding or
flooding. * Up slope surface water should be diverted away from the pile. *4.13
Composting of Manure* Composting is a biological process in which
microorganisms aerobically convert organic materials such as manure into a soil
like material called compost. It is the same process that decays leaves and
other organic debris in nature. Composting merely controls conditions so that
materials decompose faster. Composting and the uses of compost offer several
potential benefits including improved manure handling, enhanced soil tilth, and
reduced environmental risk. The composting process produces heat, which drives
off moisture and destroys pathogens and weed seeds. During the composting
process the volume of waste will be reduced by up to 50 per cent. With good
management it produces a minimum of odors. Compost is quite different from the
original materials that it was derived from. It is free of unpleasant odors, is
easy to handle, and stores for long periods of time. The rate at which manure
will compost depends on: * the moisture content * temperature * level of oxygen
available * size of manure particles, and * relative quantities of carbon and
nitrogen available to the microorganisms for use as food. An adequate supply of
oxygen is required throughout the pile. To achieve this, maintain the compost
pile at forty to fifty per-cent solids and mix the material on a regular basis.
This process can be carried out using either a windrow system, aerated static
piles or an in-vessel system, as described below. Windrow composting involves
the placement of manure on an all-weather surface in long rows. Typically the
rows are one to two meters (three to six feet) high and two to five meters (six
to sixteen feet) at the base. The piles are turned periodically to mix and
introduce air and rebuild bed porosity. This helps to insure that all the
material is uniformly composted. Although mixing can be accomplishedwith
regular farm equipment, the use of specialized equipment is usually more
efficient. Windrow composting is relatively simple and inexpensive and usually
takes one to four months, depending on the frequency of turning. Aerated static
piles are aerated directly with forced air systems to speed up the process. The
in-vessel system confines the composting material within a building or
container and uses forced air and mechanical turning to speed up the composting
process. These systems are expensive but could be practical on larger
operations. The nutrient value of the compost will vary and may require testing
before spreading. When managed properly, the composting process is aerobic and
the release of odours should be minimal and the product will have an earthy
odour. If conditions are not controlled and the manure pile begins to decompose
anaerobically, very strong odours can be produced and the process can take a
much longer period of time. To ensure that pollution is not created at the
composting site, it is recommended that: * The site is located a minimum of 90
meters (300 ft) from a watercourse or a well used for domestic purposes, *
Windrows are not located on coarse textured soils, * All clean surface water is
diverted away from the composting site. See Appendix D
php3?number=70597#d> for further information on composting. 4.14 Constructed
Wetlands A constructed wetland for waste water treatment is a man-made marsh
designed, built and operated to copy the processes found in natural wetland
ecosystems. These systems utilize wetland plants, soils and their associated
microorganisms to remove contaminants from waste water, runoff from livestock
exercise yards and manure storage areas. The reuse, or reclamation, of
wastewater using constructed wetland technology also provides an opportunity to
create or restore valuable wetland habitat for wildlife and environmental
enhancement. Constructed wetland technology can improve water quality through a
variety of biological processes that naturally occur in wetland environments.
Microorganisms that live on aquatic plants and in soils transform organic
matter and nutrients present in wastewater effluent into types of nutrients
that support a diverse community of aquatic pond life. Plants also play an
active role in taking up available nitrogen, phosphorous and other compounds
from wastewater as well as increasing the oxygen level and pH level in a
variety of wastewater solutions. Constructed wetlands for treatment of
agricultural liquid wastes under Canadian conditions are being demonstrated and
monitored in several provinces including Prince Edward Island. Preliminary
information obtained from the P.E.I. research has indicated the biological
loadings, and a number of chemical compounds have decreased to mostly
acceptable levels while treating runoff from a manure storage area and second
rinse milk house waste water. *4.15 Exercise Yard (Feedlot) Runoff* The
following are general recommendations for the siting and management of exercise
yards and feedlots. * Uncontaminated surface water should be diverted away from
cattle exercise yards and feedlots. * Contaminated runoff from cattle exercise
yards and feedlots should be contained and handled as a liquid manure or
treated in an approved treatment system. * The recommended minimum separation
distance between a new exercise yard or feedlot and a watercourse or domestic
well is 90 m (300 ft.). A 30 m (100 ft.) minimum separation distance is
recommended for a highway ditch or right-of-way. * Existing exercise yards or
feedlots should establish and maintain a 20 m (65 ft.) separation area from a
watercourse. If the slope adjacent to the watercourse is 9% or greater, then a
30 m (100 ft.) separation distance should be maintained. *4.16 Safety
Requirements for Liquid Manure Storages* _Liquid and semi-solid manure storages
must be designed and constructed according to the structural and safety
requirements of the Canadian Farm Building Code._ To minimize the possibility
of a serious accident: * _A sign warning of dangerous gases shall be installed
at every access to a liquid manure storage tank or under-floor manure transfer
chamber_. * _A permanent safety fence or wall extending to not less than 1.5m
(5 ft.) above adjacent grade shall be provided around all liquid manure
storages without fixed covers._ * _Locked child proof gates are required at all
entrance ramps and pumping ramps,_ * _Safety railing or floor grill is required
on all manure hopper openings larger than 100mm (4 ins.) in width,_ * _Ladders
shall not be installed in closed manure tanks,_ * _Covers providing access to
liquid manure storage tanks shall be permanently secured with safety chains._ *
_Effective gas traps shall be provided in all liquid manure lines between the
livestock building and outside liquid manure storage._ * Minimize the volume of
manure stored in the barn. * If animals are housed directly above the manure
storage, remove them while agitating and pumping or run the exhaust fans at
full capacity. * Install continuously running exhaust fans so that they draw
air out of any manure sumps or holding tanks in the building. *4.17 Odour
Management in Barns* The amount of odour produced by a barn depends to a large
extent on the design and management of the barn. A clean barn is the product of
proper barn design, good management practices and healthy animals. A properly
designed and managed ventilation system is also an essential component. The
manure handling system in the barn also affects odour production. Systems that
minimize the anaerobic decomposition of the manure have the least odour
production. This is accomplished by either removing the manure from the barn as
frequently as possible or by creating aerobic conditions for the manure. Straw
based systems are still frequently used in cattle operations. The use of straw
and other bedding material can maintain aerobic conditions if enough material
is used and the bedding is frequently changed. Most barns with liquid manure
systems are designed with shallow pits that are emptied frequently. Other
systems are available that have better odour control than shallow pits, such as
solid/liquid separation, in barn composting or modification of exhaust air,
however the equipment and labour costs have made these systems impractical on
most P.E.I. farms. *4.18 Manure Storage Odour Control* Manure storage odours
are generally associated with open liquid manure storages. Since most liquid
manure is stored anaerobically, the gases formed during the anaerobic
decomposition process can create odour problems when released to the air. Odour
control focuses on manure management options as well as location in respect to
neighbours. Separation distance is often the most practical way of avoiding
odour complaints. Separation allows the dilution of odours to reasonable levels
before they reach sensitive neighbours. However, adequate separation distance
is sometimes difficult to find in Prince Edward Island due to the smaller farm
land base and the residential development that exists in many rural
communities. Odour management approaches that have been used to assist with
control of odours from open storages are: * Avoid using sites that will be
subject to the movement of odours toward neighbours * Use of covers to prevent
the movement of air over the surface of the manure. Good quality barley straw
applied to the open manure surface with a straw blower to a depth of 150 mm (6
inches) has provided effective odour control for an extended period of time. *
Use of the "molehill" type of transfer/storage system. This system consists of
a pump which transfers the semi-solid or solid manure through an underground
pipeline. The manure is forced up, into the bottom of the manure pile. The
outer surface of the mushrooming pile forms a crust which provides an effective
means of odour control. * Planting trees or constructing earth berms around
open storages to reduce the movement of air over the manure surface, thereby
reducing the amount of odour released. The trees will also reduce the visual
impact of the storage. * Locating the inlet to the storage below the surface of
the manure so that the surface is not disturbed when the liquid manure is
added. * Emptying the storage in late spring reduces odour production during
the hot summer months. * Using biological mixtures to reduce the release and
formation of odourous gases has been reported by users of this material to have
had some success in reducing manure odours. The limited research, done to date,
on these types of products has been inconclusive. *Published jointly by:

php3?number=70587</=E> / GUIDELINES FOR MANURE MANAGEMENT FOR PRINCE EDWARD
ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / 4. MANURE STORAGE
php3?number=70799</=E> / Planning & Design *4.1 Introduction* Section 4 deals
with planning and design of new manure storages, composting, collection and
treatment of runoff, safety requirements, and odour management around the barn
and manure storage. Due to the nature of our climate as well as our seasonal
cropping systems, it is necessary to store manure for various periods of time.
The length of manure storage time depends on many factors. The storage capacity
should allow for 7 months of liquid manure accumulation to efficiently utilize
the manure for crop production. A solid manure storage should allow for a
minimum of 60 days accumulation of manure in combination with field storage.
*4.2 Existing Manure Storages* Existing livestock operations that have adequate
manure storage facilities and are not causing environmental concerns are deemed
to be in compliance with these guidelines. However, existing livestock
operations that do not have adequate manure storage facilities, and are causing
pollution of surface water or groundwater or other environmental concerns, are
deemed to be in non-compliance with these guidelines. These manure storages
should be upgraded with a new or expanded manure storage facility. *4.3
Planning a New Manure Storage* A well planned manure storage system is needed
to realize the potential value of manure and to avoid pollution problems.
Manure storage structures or location must be designed and operated to contain
manure, other wastes, and contaminated runoff in an environmentally sound
manner. The facility must be sized to hold wastes until they can be safely used
as a fertilizer. The design of the storage will depend upon the location, soil
type, the size required, the characteristics of the manure and the methods of
filling and emptying the manure storage. *4.4 Selecting a Manure Storage
System* A manure storage system should be able to provide: * Protection of
groundwater and surface water, * Minimum odour levels, * Capacity that ensures
manure can be stored until it can be efficiently used on the land, * Minimum
nutrient losses during storage and handling. Choice of the most appropriate
system will also involve a consideration of the following: * The moisture
content of the manure, * Safety and security of persons and livestock, * Labour
efficiencies and costs of complete systems, (including capital costs and
operating costs), * The quality and adaptability of equipment and systems to
meet present and future needs, * The location of the storage in relation to
streams and watercourses, wells, neighbours, roads, etc., * Size and type of
spreading equipment to complete the job in as few days as possible, both to
minimize the duration of odours and to proceed with other field operations.
*4.5 Siting For Manure Storages* The storage should be located close enough to
the barns to allow for convenient filling and still permit future expansion of
the facilities. It should be accessible to pumping and field spreading
equipment. To avoid collecting surface run-off and to reduce volume
requirements, the storage should be located in a well drained area and surface
water should be diverted away from the area, if necessary. Do not construct
manure storages near streams, watercourses or a well. Provide an effective
vegetative strip between a manure storage and a watercourse. *Leachate, manure
and manure contaminated liquid from a manure storage must not enter a
watercourse.* The minimum separation distance between a manure storage and a
neighbour's well depends on several factors including the type of storage, soil
type, depth to bedrock, etc. *The base distance of 90 m (300 ft.) should be
increased by the multiplication factor for various soil types as noted in
Appendix B, Column 4.* Also the Minimum Separation Distances recommended in
Section 7
php3?number=73112#7> should be followed to minimize odour nuisance. The soil,
bedrock and groundwater conditions should be evaluated by a qualified
professional to ensure that the site is suitable for the type of storage
planned. Refer to sections 4.7
php3?number=70799#4.7> to 4.11
php3?number=70799#4.11> for further information on manure storage design. *4.6
Types of Manure Storage Structures* Manure can be handled as a solid, semi-
solid or a liquid, depending upon the chosen system of animal management and
individual operator preferences. Many alternatives differ simply in their
degree of automation. The consistency of fresh manure is often changed within
the handling system by such things as the addition of bedding, dilution water
or natural air drying. The moisture content of manure affects its consistency,
and hence is the most important single factor when considering the selection of
handling equipment and storage facilities. *Solid Manure: *Livestock manure can
be handled as a solid if sufficient bedding is added. Manure transfer to long
term storage adjacent to the livestock facility usually includes the use of
either a conventional continuous chain barn cleaner, a shuttle cleaner, tractor
with loader, ram or compressed air pump system. *Solid manure should be stored
on a curbed, concrete pad. Runoff from solid manure should be contained within
the storage itself or collected in a separate liquid holding structure of
suitable material to achieve an expected hydraulic conductivity of 1x10^-7 cm/
sec.* Systems such as vegetative filter strips or constructed wetlands may also
be considered for treatment of runoff from solid manure storages. Runoff from
livestock feedlots should be handled in a similar manner as runoff from a solid
manure pile. Storage of solid manure may be possible in open field piles under
certain conditions. Refer to Section 4.12
php3?number=70799#4.12> for more information on field manure piles. *Semi-solid
(Slurry) Manure: *In many modern livestock facilities where bedding is limited,
manure is produced that is neither a liquid nor a solid. The resulting thick
semi-solid manure does not flow as readily as liquid manure, nor will it pile
in a similar manner as solid manure. In order to handle semi-solid manure,
specialized storages and handling equipment must be utilized. Semi-solid manure
is most commonly transferred to long term storage with the aid of a ram
orcompressed air pump, or by gravity flow in a large pipe. Storages are bottom
loaded if filled in this manner. This results in the formation of a crust on
the surface of the manure which aids in minimizing odours. *Semi-solid manure
is stored in a structure designed to retain the entire volume of manure and has
the same storage capacity requirements as liquid manure.* *Semi-solid manure
storages may be either designed as a liquid manure storage or designed to
permit tractor access.* If tractor access is used , the storage must have a
concrete floor, curbs and access ramp, to allow easy access by the manure
removal equipment. *Liquid Manure: *Liquid manure is a fast efficient way of
handling large volumes of manure. It is produced when there is little or no
bedding used. Sometimes the manure is diluted with waste water to increase the
moisture content to make it suitable for pumping (over 90 % moisture). Liquid
manure is moved into storage through pipes by gravity or by pumps. *Liquid
manure storages are usually open top circular concrete structures, in ground or
partially above ground. If a structural roof is required, the storage is
usually rectangular in shape.* *4.7 Manure Storage Capacity* Sustainable use of
manure should include a total crop management system and all the nutrients used
on the farm over the long term. Crop requirements can be met with a combination
of commercial fertilizers, manure and residual soil nutrients. The manure
storage volume should allow for the farm operator to spread manure on land at
optimal times for maximum nutrient utilization. *The liquid manure/slurry
storage facility should be sized to contain a minimum of seven months (210
days) of manure production and accumulated precipitation. The in-barn manure
storage is included in the total manure storage capacity. A solid manure
storage should be sized to contain a minimum of 60 days storage capacity at the
barn and supplemented with field storage. If field storage is not an option,
then a 210 day storage at the barn is recommended.* This will permit some
flexibility in timing the manure removal so that spreading in unsuitable
weather and/or field conditions can be avoided. A bedded manure pack within a
barn is considered to be a solid storage manure system. The volume of manure
produced must be determined in order to calculate storage requirements. The
volume of manure produced depends on many factors including; the management
practices, type and number of animals, storage time, water spillage, wash water
used, type of feed and feeding equipment, and the amount of bedding used. To
estimate manure storage requirements, evaluate an existing operation that is
similar to the planned facility or use the animal manure production information
in Table 1 <#table1> for guidance. *_Seasonal Capacity_: Liquid and semi-solid
manure storages should have, on November 1^st of each year, manure storage
space available to contain, without losses of solids or liquids to the
environment, the manure produced and accumulated precipitation during the
following 210 days.* *Solid manure storages should have, on November 1^st of
each year, without losses of solids or liquids to the environment the manure
produced and accumulated precipitation during the following 60 days when
suitable field piling is available, otherwise 210 days storage is required.*
*_Minimum Freeboard_: *Liquid and semi-solid manure storage should have some
reserve capacity to allow for normal variations in manure production or greater
than normal precipitation during the storage period. *A freeboard of 300 mm (1
foot) should be maintained at all times.* *4.8 Subsurface Evaluations For
Manure Storages* The subsurface conditions at the proposed manure storage site
must be evaluated in order to determine which storage types will be permitted
and if there will be any special design or construction requirements. The first
step in the planning of a subsurface investigation should be an examination of
the relevant maps from "The Prince Edward Island Soil Survey, 1988". These maps
should complement but not take the place of a detailed subsurface
investigation. The level of survey detail, accuracy, limits of the soil map and
purity of map unit components should be considered in assessing information
about any area. Pre-printed maps are available at a scale of 1:10000 from the
Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3>, Research Station, Charlottetown, P.E.I. Appendix
B indicates possible concerns (if any) related to the siting of manure
handling/storage facilities for each of the thirty-five (35) mineral soil types
from the P.E.I. Soil Survey, 1988. The eight (8) non-soil organic (peat) map
units are not included as they would definitely be unsuitable for the
construction of such a facility. Where the dominant soil type presents
increased risk for pollution of surface and groundwater, then the recommended
separation distances to wells should be increased by the factor indicated in
Appendix B
php3?number=70597#b>, Column 4. *Test Pits: *At each proposed manure storage
site, a sufficient number of test pits should be dug with a backhoe or
excavator to permit an adequate description of the subsurface conditions (soil
types, depths to bedrock or water table). Test pits should be located in
consideration of the proposed design and dimensions of the storage structure
and should be logged by qualified geotechnical personnel. Test pits should
extend to a depth of at least 1 m (3.3 feet) below the base of the proposed
storage. Variable subsurface conditions may require several test pits in order
to adequately characterize the subsurface conditions. Test pit locations and
elevations should be accurately established and shown on a site plan for the
proposed storage. *TABLE 1* *MANURE PRODUCTION RATES* *CLASS OF ANIMAL* *MANURE

Canadian Farm Buildings Handbook (1988) *4.9 Design and Construction of
Concrete or Metal Tanks* Liquid manure storages may be of several types. The
most common are: in-ground open circular concrete tanks, in-ground rectangular
concrete tanks, covered and uncovered, and earthen pits (lagoons). *In-ground
*concrete tanks are more costly than earthen storages. However, they are
impermeable and are more suitable for use in locations having sandy soils or a
high water table level. A covered manure storage will not generally release
odours except when it is being emptied. Less nutrients are lost when a covered
storage is used. Concrete tanks require proper design to withstand all earth,
hydrostatic, and ice pressures, as well as live loads. *Above ground* tanks are
either circular silo types or rectangular structures. Depending on the size,
the silo structures are generally more expensive than in-ground concrete tanks.
Above ground tanks may be the only choice when soil conditions do not permit
the use of in-ground structures. The above ground storages may be constructed
from preformed concrete panels, cast-in-place concrete or glass lined steel
panels. The following are general requirements for the design and construction
of *new or modified non-earthen manure storages:* * _All manure storage
structures must be designed and constructed in accordance with the latest
editions of the National Building Code of Canada, and the Canadian Farm
Building Code._ * _the concrete base of the storage must be a minimum of 0.5m
(20") above bedrock unless an alternative methodology can be used to protect
the ground water._ * _The base of the storage must be 0.5m (20") above the
level of the high water table_. * _A building permit, issued by the authority
having jurisdiction, may be required for concrete or metal tank manure
storages_. * _Plans for the manure storage must be stamped by the engineer who
is taking responsibility for the design._ * _Plans must be submitted and
approved by the Department of Technology and Environment prior to the beginning
of construction_. * _The manure storage must be constructed according to the
approved plans_. * _Upon completion of the project, a Certificate of Inspection
must be signed by the design engineer and submitted to the Department of
Technology and Environment_. * An emergency plan should be available for a
major spill of liquid manure. *4.10 Design and Construction of Earthen
Storages* The following are general requirements for the design and
construction of *new or modified earthen manure storages:* * _The earthen base
of the storage must be a minimum of 1 m (40") above bedrock unless an
alternative methodology can be used to protect the ground water._ * _The base
of the storage must be 1 m (40") above the maximum water table elevation_ * _A
building permit, issued by the authority having jurisdiction, may be required
for earthen manure storages._ * _Plans for the manure storage must be stamped
by the engineer who is taking responsibility for the design._ * _Plans must be
submitted and approved by the Department of Technology and Environment prior to
the beginning of construction._ * _The manure storage must be constructed
according to the approved plans._ * _Upon completion of the project, a
Certificate of Inspection must be signed by the design engineer and submitted
to the Department of Technology and Environment_. * An emergency plan should be
available for a major spill of liquid manure. In order to ensure that an
earthen manure storage is capable of minimizing potential surface or
groundwater pollution, the following minimum design and construction standards
should be used. *Seepage Control Using Natural Soil*:The floor and side slopes
of the storage may be constructed in suitable native soil or lined with a
minimum of 600 mm (2 ft.) of compacted soil mined from an approved source. To
ensure effective sealing of the soil surface, natural soil used as a liner must
satisfy the minimum grain size distribution requirements specified in Table 2.
Liner soil should be placed in maximum 150 mm (6 in.) layers and compacted to
at least 98% of the material's Standard Proctor Maximum Dry Density. The
maximum expected in-place, hydraulic conductivity of natural soil liners should
be 1x10^-7 cm/sec. for liquid swine manure and 1x10^-6 cm/sec. for dairy
manure. _Field and laboratory testing must be carried out by qualified
geotechnical personnel during construction of the storage and liner._ *TABLE 2

0.002 mm minimum of 5% minimum of 15% *Seepage Control Using a Synthetic Liner:
*If the storage is sited on soils which do not meet the requirements of Table 2
<#table2> or where suitable natural soil is unavailable, the storage should be
lined with a flexible membrane, concrete or equivalent material. Protect
synthetic liners with a granular cover layer in accordance with the
recommendations of the liner manufacturer. A leak detection system is
recommended in combination with a synthetic liner. *Side Slopes Stability: *To
allow for long term slope stability and to facilitate placement of liners and
cover material, inside slopes should not be steeper than 1.5:1 (horizontal:
vertical) in undisturbed soil or 2:1 where a compacted soil liner exists.
Outside slopes should not be steeper than 3:1 and should be seeded with grass
and maintained. To ensure structural stability and prevent leakage, embankments
(berms) built up with fill must be placed in maximum 300 mm (12 in.) layers and
compacted to at least 98% of the material's Standard Proctor Maximum Dry
Density. *Berm Width*: Berms should have a top width not less than 2.4 meters
(8 ft.) in order to provide sufficient stability to the berm as well as access
for agitation and pumping equipment. *Depth to Bedrock*: The bottom of an
earthen storage should be a minimum of 1.0 m (3.3 ft.) above bedrock. *Depth to
Water Table*: The bottom of an earthen storage should be a minimum of 1.0 m
(3.3 ft.) above the maximum water table elevation. *Distance to Subsurface
Drains: *The lateral distance from an earthen manure storage to a subsurface
drain should be a minimum of 15 meters (50 ft.). *Agitator Pads*: Concrete pads
should be installed below inlets and at agitation/pump out points to reduce the
loss of soil fines and erosion of the bottom. *4.11 Design and Construction of
Solid Manure Storages* Solid (stacked) manure should be stored on a concrete
pad, either with or without a roof. Any runoff from the solid manure storage
should be collected, stored and handled as if it were liquid manure. Systems
such as vegetative filter strips or constructed wetlands may also be considered
for treatment of runoff from solid manure storages. New manure storages that do
not have a concrete slab base should have a minimum of 0.5 m (20") of compacted
earth (95% Standard Proctor Maximum Dry Density) so as to provide an expected
hydraulic conductivity of 1x10^-7 cm/sec to prevent leachate from entering the
groundwater. Refer to Table 2 <#table2> for recommended particle size analysis.
In order to contain the manure and prevent runoff, an earthen dyke in
combination with a 1.2m (4 ft) reinforced concrete wall is recommended. By
sloping the floor to one corner opposite the entrance ramp, excess liquids can
be removed by a vacuum tanker. Emptying the storage is usually done with a
front end loader. Up slope surface water should be diverted away from the
storage. In addition to the above, the following are general requirements for
the design and construction of solid manure storages: * _A building permit, if
required, shall be issued by the Authority having jurisdiction_ * Plans for the
manure storage should be prepared by an experienced person and in all cases
approved by the Department of Technology and Environment in consultation with
the Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> prior to beginning construction. * _The manure
storage must be constructed according to approved plans_. Last Updated : 2005-

ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / 5. LAND APPLICATION OF MANURE
php3?number=73079</=E> / Manure *5.1 Manure a Sustainable Resource*** Spreading
manure on land is a highly desirable method of recycling a natural, organic by-
product of livestock production. A sustainable agricultural system should
include manure as a fertilizer for crop production. Manure is readily available
with a minimal input of energy and can significantly decrease crop production
costs. Most livestock operations are surrounded by large areas of productive
agricultural land. To prevent damage to crops, minimize the risk of pollution
and obtain the maximum benefit of the manure as a fertilizer, manure
application rates should match the crop nutrient requirements. Too much of a
good thing can lead to problems. Manure is an excellent fertilizer which poses
an environmental risk only when mismanaged. Animal manure can be a valuable
soil amendment. When properly managed, it not only acts as a source of plant
nutrients, but also helps improve soil tilth, structure, aeration and water-
holding properties through the addition of organic matter. The goals of every
livestock producer should be to: * maximize the utilization of the manure
nutrients by crops; * minimize the nuisance created by spreading manure; *
minimize the risk of polluting surface and groundwater. *5.2 Minimize Odour
During Spreading* *5.2.1 Equipment Selection For Liquid Manure* The amount of
odour released during manure spreading depends on the exposure of the manure to
the air. More care in the timing and location of spreading will be necessary
when the spreading equipment creates more air exposure of the manure. Surface
application has traditionally been undertaken with manure tankers that spray
the manure into the air. This equipment is relatively inexpensive and easily
adapted to most situations. The negative aspects of manure tankers can be
minimized as follows: * discharge the manure as close to the ground as possible
with dribble bars to minimize exposure of the manure to the atmosphere; and, *
incorporate the manure into the soil as soon as possible. *Irrigation equipment
is not recommended for manure application due to excessive odour production and
high nitrogen losses.* *Incorporation of Manure:* The longer the interval
between spreading and incorporation, the greater the nitrogen losses and the
greater the potential for odours to create a nuisance for neighbours. Producers
should attempt to incorporate the manure the same day it is spread.
*Incorporation should occur within 48 hours after application, unless applied
to hay or pasture land or exceptional circumstances exist.* The success of any
method of application depends largely upon the abilities of the operator. With
proper management, each system can be used in a manner that prevents pollution,
minimizes odour and applies manure at a rate that matches the crop
requirements. *5.2.2 Public Relations* Neighbours are less likely to complain
if they understand the problems of odour control. They will also be more
tolerant if they are aware that a genuine effort is being made by the producer
to minimize the odours, not only in land application but also with storage as
discussed previously. If at all possible, inform your neighbours of your
intentions to spread and attempt to accommodate them by spreading at times when
odours are least likely to be a problem. Maintaining good communication with
neighbours is important in avoiding conflicts. Most people will recognize good
intentions and will not have unreasonable expectations. When spreading manure,
maintain separation distances that are reasonable for the type of equipment in
use, consider the weather conditions, and choose an appropriate time to spread.
Showing consideration for one's neighbours is important for good public
relations. When using a public roadway to transport manure to the fields, it is
important for the operator to use proper equipment to avoid spills and leaks
occurring on the roadway. If manure or dirt is deposited on the roadway, the
owner/operator should remove it as soon as possible. (Refer to P.E.I /Roads
Act/
www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/r-15.pdf>) *Manure should not be spread during
the period of June 20^th to September 8^th unless it is absolutely necessary.
During this period, manure should only be applied for the fertilization of hay,
pasture land, summer fallow land or to establish cover crops. Manure applied to
summer fallow land or for establishing cover crops should be incorporated
within 48 hours.* Where possible, consider the following factors when deciding
on where and when to spread: * Manure spread in cool or cold weather will
create less odour than manure spread in warm weather. * The best time to spread
is early in the day when air near the ground will tend to become warm and rise,
carrying the odours upward where they will be diluted. The manure will dry
during the day and less odour will be released by evening. * Wind direction and
speed are critical. Wind will help to dilute the odours by increased mixing
with the air. Caution must be used to avoid situations where winds will carry
odours directly toward a neighbour. * On calm, humid days, rapid drying of the
manure and dilution of the odours will not occur. A gentle breeze may carry the
undiluted odours toward neighbours. * The presence of trees and windbreaks will
help to mix and dilute the odours by creating turbulence. * Be considerate when
using fields a short distance upwind of neighbours and try to spread only when
weather conditions are ideal ( cool and windy weekday morning). Last Updated :

ISLAND
php3?number=70588</=E> / 5. LAND APPLICATION OF MANURE
php3?number=73079</=E> / Manure Application Rates *5.4 **Manure Application
Rate* Nitrogen is usually the nutrient that limits manure application rate,
however with long term application, phosphorous may become the limiting factor.
The rate of application will ultimately be determined by the rate at which the
nutrients are used by the crop and by the reserves of nitrogen or phosphorous
in the soil. The fertility of a field should be determined by soil testing.
Depending on how the manure has been handled, the nutrient content of the
manure can vary widely. The manure should, therefore, be tested for nutrient
content as well. The application rate can be calculated from this information
together with knowledge of the method of application, timing and soil
conditions. The application rate is often based on estimated soil and manure
nutrient levels. These inaccuracies may lead to application rates lower or
higher than required. A moderate over-application will not immediately lead to
pollution problems or crop damage, especially during dry periods. With
excessive application rates, nitrogen and phosphorous will generally accumulate
in the soil and this accumulation can be detected through subsequent soil
fertility tests. If an accumulation occurs, the rate of application should be
reduced accordingly. Recording the manure spreading time and rate on each field
is one way to avoid long-term over-application and ensure accurate records if
needed. *5.4.1 Nutrient Losses During Storage and Application* The nutrient
content of manure (particularly nitrogen) declines with time during collection,
storage and land application. This is due to such processes as ammonia
volatization, as well as leaching and surface runoff of all soluble forms of
nutrients (particularly nitrate). Proper management can reduce losses, maximize
the nutrient value of the manure and minimize potential soil and water
pollution. This includes using proper facilities for storage and handling,
applying manure to cool, moist soil in fall or early spring and incorporating
it immediately (or applying it by subsurface injection). A summary of typical
values of nutrient losses from various sources is presented in Appendix C
php3?number=70597#c>. *5.4.2 Soil and Crop Implications* There is considerable
variation in the amount of nitrogen required by different crops. Forage crops
such as alfalfa can utilize much more nitrogen than annual cereal crops.
Alfalfa is a deep rooted plant and is therefore capable of withdrawing nitrates
which may have leached out of the soils near the surface. The soil
characteristics of the field where manure will be spread should be known. On
sandy soils, time the spreading of manure to maximize use of the nutrients by
the crop. The application rate on clay soils may be limited by the rate at
which the liquid manure can infiltrate into the soil. Limit the application
rate of liquid manure to avoid ponding.*Manure should not be applied to soil
that has a moisture content greater than its field capacity*. The soil is at
field capacity if free water is visible when a handful of soil is squeezed. The
yield potential and the nitrogen requirement is considerably higher on heavier
textured clay soils than on well-drained sandy soils. In addition, the risk of
groundwater pollution by the leaching of nitrates is lower on heavy textured
soils than on sandy soils. The allowable manure application rate is therefore
higher on heavier textured soils. *5.4.3 Calculating the Application Rate* The
application rate of manure should not exceed the amount necessary to meet the
crop nitrogen requirements. These guidelines present two methods of calculating
application rates: * an estimated land base area using typical nutrient
production rates; and, * a detailed method using site specific manure and soil
test results. *5.4.4 Estimate of Land Base Required* *This method provides an
estimated land base for manure based on typical rates of nitrogen and phosphate
excreted by livestock. Variations in management practices from farm-to-farm can
result in wide ranges in manure nutrient values. In addition, the nutrient
levels remaining in the soil after a crop can also vary. Because of this the
detailed method following is the preferred method of determining the manure
application rate.* Often the manure and soil test results are not available.
The estimated land base is therefore very useful in many situations. Use
*Worksheet #1* and the information in Tables 4, <#table4> 5 <#table5>and 6
<#table6> to calculate the estimated manure application rate. For crops not
listed in Table 6 <#table6>, or in low or highly productive soils where the
crop yields and nitrogen utilization may vary from the values assumed in Table
6 <#table6>, an adjustment will have to be made in the application rate. For
unusual site - specific conditions consult with a professional agrologist for
detailed recommendations. *EXAMPLE WORKSHEET 1* *ESTIMATE THE LAND BASE

Nutrient Management Plans* The efficient utilization of manure nutrients
requires on-farm sampling and laboratory analysis to determine the exact
nutrient content. Use *Worksheet 2A or 2B* when the results of representative
soil or manure tests are available. *5.4.6. Nutrient Management Strategies* The
proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus in manure seldom matches crop nutrient
requirements. If manure is applied to just meet the crop nitrogen requirements,
there will normally be an excess of phosphorus applied. When the same land
receives annual applications of manure based on the manure supplying all the
nitrogen requirements, there could be a buildup of phosphorus in the soil.
Annual soil tests should be carefully monitored to ensure there is no risk of
pollution or nutrient imbalances. When manure is applied to just meet the crop
phosphorus requirements, there will be a shortfall in the nitrogen available to
the crop. It is therefore necessary to add supplemental inorganic nitrogen to
make up this shortfall. There is limited information available with respect to
the crop response to manure phosphorus. Crop response to phosphorus is
dependant on the method of application since phosphorus is not as mobile in the
soil as nitrogen. When fertilizing with manure for the first time, care should
be exercised to ensure that sufficient phosphorus is applied. In general, 50%
of the total phosphorous in manure is available to plants in the first year. To
ensure enough phosphorous is available to a growing crop, add 14 to 17 kg./ha
of P_2 O_5 as a starter fertilizer with the seed. Check the fertilizer
recommendations of specific crops for any seed placed fertilizer restrictions.
A recommended nutrient strategy is to apply manure to supply approximately 75
percent of the crop nitrogen requirements. The remaining 25 percent is then
supplied with inorganic nitrogen applied with the seed. This has the added
advantage of providing a "pop-up" effect to young plants, due to the close
proximity of nitrogen to the roots of the seedling plants. Although there may
still be a moderate excess of phosphorus using this nutrient management
strategy, annual soil testing will indicate if there is a concern over time.

Listing(1998). *5.4.7 Soil and Manure Testing * Soil and manure testing
requires forethought and planning. Set a schedule for borrowing the necessary
equipment and taking samples. Follow the recommended procedures below to be
sure that the samples are truly representative. Schedule the soil sampling well
in advance of spreading to be certain that the laboratory results will be
available on time. Soil sampling equipment is usually available from the
laboratory that will analyze the samples. There are several different options
for liquid manure sampling. The first option is to collect representative
manure samples while the manure is being spread. Collect samples from the
beginning, the middle and the end of the manure spreading, since the manure
consistency generally changes during the time when the manure is emptied from
the tank. Keep samples covered and cool, fill only 75% full to allow space for
gas expansion. Although the analysis of the samples will not be available for
planning the manure spreading for that year, the results will be valid for
planning the spreading in subsequent years. The second and preferred option is
to sample manure from the storage before the manure spreading begins. Probes
for collecting manure samples from manure storages are commercially available
and consist of a long tube with a removable plug at the bottom end. With the
bottom of the tube open, the tube is lowered slowly into the liquid manure to
enclose a column of liquid. When filled, the bottom of the tube is plugged and
the column of liquid can be removed. By sampling at a number of locations in
the storage, representative samples of the manure can be collected and sent to
a laboratory for analysis. Another alternative is to use a nitrogen meter, that
will provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the ammonium nitrogen in the
manure. These meters provide results immediately, and while not as accurate as
laboratory analysis, are better than published average values of manure
fertilizer content. *EXAMPLE WORKSHEET 2 A LIQUID MANURE APPLICATION RATES -

only source of nitrogen there is normally an excess of phosphorus applied. If
applying manure annually to the same fields using this management practice,
annual soil tests must be carefully reviewed to ensure phosphorus does not
build up to levels that could cause pollution or nutrient imbalances. *EXAMPLE
WORKSHEET 2B* *LIQUID MANURE APPLICATION RATES - DETAILED METHOD (APPLIED TO

divide by 1000 to obtain kg/1000L. Manure Phosphorus Content _1310 mg/kg_

based upon the crop phosphate requirements. Divide the recommended phosphate

to just meet the crop phosphate requirements there will normally be a shortfall
of nitrogen to meet the crop nitrogen requirements. It is therefore necessary
to add supplemental nitrogen when using this management practice. *TABLE 7:

**Recommended Setbacks For Spreading Manure* The slope of the land must be
considered when spreading manure. As the slope increases, so does the chance
that manure may run off and so application rates should be reduced and
distances from watercourses increased. Sloping land should be maintained with a
reasonable amount of crop cover to provide protection against manure runoff. In
order to reduce the risk of runoff entering surface waters or wells, a
separation area is necessary to absorb the runoff and prevent it from traveling
down a slope. The effectiveness of the separation area depends upon factors
such as soil conditions and application rate. Good judgment must be used in all
cases to ensure that runoff cannot enter water sources. It should be understood
that due to extenuating circumstances, such as weather, it may not always be
possible to meet the time limits for spreading manure. Recommended minimum
setback distances for spreading are illustrated in Table 3 <#table3>. These are
minimum distances to be used in conjunction with good management practices.

crops or with minimal trash cover. Where a perennial forage crop or good trash
cover is present, distances may be reduced by one-half.* *5.3.2 Water and Soil
Pollution* Both commercial fertilizer and manure can cause pollution if not
properly managed. By spreading manure in accordance with these Guidelines, the
risk of water pollution is minimized. Although livestock are efficient in
converting feed to body tissue, a portion of the nutrients in the feed are not
used by the animal and are excreted in the manure. The nutrient content of the
manure depends upon the animal age, the feed type and the manure management
system as described below. *Animal Age* - Manure constituents are the feed
products remaining after digestion by the animal. As animals grow, their
ability to convert the nutrients in the feed to body tissue changes. Animals
that are actively growing will utilize some nutrients more efficiently than
mature animals. *Feed Type* - If a ration is unbalanced, the animal will not be
able to use all of the nutrients, and excess nutrients will be excreted.
Altering the animal's diet to closely match its needs in each growth phase
(phase feeding) is becoming increasingly popular in hog production. In
addition, enzymes and specific amino acids can be used to modify rations for
increased feed efficiency and reduce nitrogen and phosphorous in the manure.
*Manure Management System* - The amount of nutrients lost depends on how the
manure is stored and spread. The amount of water added by washing, or the
amount of straw or shavings added as bedding will also change the manure
properties. The methods of handling, storing and spreading manure also affect
the final nutrient content. Nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium not used by the animal are returned to the soil where they are used
by the crop. However, when proper management is not used in spreading manure,
erosion, runoff and leaching may transfer the nutrients away from the soil and
into water sources, causing pollution. Surface water pollution can be caused by
nutrients running off the fields and moving into ditches, etc. Consequently,
the risk of surface water pollution increases with practices such as winter
spreading, when manure moisture is not immediately absorbed by the soil. Runoff
can be minimized by using good management practices that include: * proper
application rates, * rapid incorporation, * maintaining good surface trash
cover, * maintaining a grassy separation area along watercourses. Manure in
surface water will affect the following water quality characteristics:
turbidity, color, suspended solids, levels of nitrate or ammonia, phosphorus,
potassium and microbes. The organic material in the manure will decompose and
consume the dissolved oxygen in the water. Excess settled solids and nitrogen
compounds can kill aquatic life forms. The nutrients in the manure may increase
the growth of aquatic plants that can disrupt the ecosystem of the water body.
Bacteria and viruses may be introduced, increasing the potential for spreading
diseases. The presence of excessive nitrates in drinking water can create a
health hazard for humans and reduce the performance of livestock. It is
therefore important to ensure that manure storages are secure and that land
spreading is performed at proper rates. Groundwater pollution is usually due to
the downward movement of leachable substances ( nitrogen, phosphorous) through
the soil. If the amount of nitrogen added to the soil consistently exceeds the
amount of nitrogen removed by the crops, then nitrogen will accumulate in the
soil. In coarse textured soils, water movement through the soil can rapidly
leach excessive nitrate downwards into the underlying groundwater. Annual soil
testing is recommended as an effective and economical method of protecting
groundwater sources. Over application of manure to soils can also result in the
build up of nutrients in the soil. When the nutrient concentrations become too
high, nutrients such as nitrate (the most water soluble form of Nitrogen) can
move through the soil to groundwater as mentioned above. Also, prolonged over-
application of manure can lead to an imbalance in the soil chemistry which will
result in reduced crop yields. High concentrations of manure are toxic to
plants. *5.3.3 Sensitive Groundwater Areas* In some areas, soil and groundwater
conditions may be sensitive to agricultural practices which involve the
application of either inorganic or organic (manure) fertilizers. The degree of
sensitivity depends on the type and depth of the overburden above an aquifer
and the type of vegetation at the soil surface. Where very permeable soils such
as coarse sands or gravels immediately overlay an aquifer or where the
overburden above an aquifer is very shallow, nutrients applied to the soil
surface may leach rapidly downward beyond crop rooting depths and quickly reach
the aquifer. In addition, since these areas tend to be well drained, crop
vegetation is often relatively sparse and plant uptake of nutrients is low.
Where such sensitive groundwater conditions exist, manure and inorganic
fertilizer applications should be avoided or greatly reduced from those rates
recommended in Section 5.4, Application Rate
php3?number=73079#5.4>. Consult a professional agronomist for site specific
recommendations in these sensitive areas before applying manure. *5.3.4 Factors
Affecting Manure Application System Selection* Accuracy and uniformity of
manure application become more important when manure is used as the only source
of fertilizer. An under-application could reduce yields; an over-application
could cause lodging or delayed maturity which creates problems with harvesting
and potential environmental contamination. When manure is not uniformly spread,
some areas of the field may receive too much fertilizer, while other parts of
the field may not receive enough. Unless the manure can be applied accurately
at the specified rate, many crops will not be able to utilize the full value of
the manure as a fertilizer. *5.3.5 Soil Compaction* The system should minimize
soil compaction unless manure spreading can be scheduled for periods when
fields are dry. The compaction caused by tankers can be minimized by using
large flotation tires. *5.3.6 Seasonal Considerations* Manure will gradually
decompose in the soil zone. As decomposition occurs, nutrients from the manure
become available for use by the plant. These nutrients, however, also become
susceptible to losses through leaching or runoff. Spring is the best time to
apply manure, since the crop will be able to use the nutrients as they become
available. Soil compaction can be a problem in spring, however, since the land
is often not dry enough to handle the heavy wheel loads involved with certain
types of spreading methods. Fall application will usually result in the loss of
more nutrients than spring application if the manure is not incorporated into
the soil. Fall applied manure to winter cover crops will be well utilized. Fall
application usually results in more time available for spreading. In addition,
the soil is often quite firm and if compaction does occur, winter freezing and
thawing can reduce the damage. Summer application is suitable for pastures and
forage crops. Because summer is the time when neighbours are most active
outdoors, spreading at this time of year requires extra consideration regarding
odour production. Refer to 5.3.1
php3?number=73079#5.3.1> and Table 3 <#table3> for spreading setbacks. *Winter
application of manure should not occur because of the high potential for runoff
and surface water pollution as well as high nutrient losses due to these
factors. * If winter spreading is necessary, apply only if the potential for
surface runoff is minimal. Apply to stubble fields with good trash cover or
fields in perennial forage crops. Increase setback distances from watercourses
and wells. *5.3.7 Spreading Agreements* Livestock operations which do not have
sufficient land base to effectively utilize the manure for growing crops should
enter into written agreements with other land owners for the land application
of manure for the purpose of growing crops. *Spreading agreements should have a
minimum duration of two years.* Spreading agreements should reference the
manure management practices outlined in these guidelines. Last Updated : 2005-

Livestock Unit* A term called *"Livestock Unit"* is used to equate all
livestock types in terms of *relative odour intensity.* Therefore different
livestock types can be accommodated in one table (See Table 8 <#table8>). *6.2
Commercial Livestock Operations - Minimum Size* A commercial livestock
operation is defined as any livestock operation where: * The livestock facility
has the capacity to accommodate the equivalent of 40 or more dairy cows plus
replacements. (See Table 8 below <#table8>) * The manure production from the
livestock facility exceeds 2,400 liters per day. *TABLE 8: EXAMPLE OF MINIMUM
NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK THAT REQUIRES AN ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVAL FOR NEW AND
EXPANDED OPERATIONS.* *LIVESTOCK OPERATION* *NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK* Beef Cow and

Broilers Poultry (caged layers) 16000 Layers Turkey (10kg) 8000 Toms Horse and
offspring 60 Mares Adult sheep 800 Ewes *6.3 Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) Process* Construction of livestock facilities and manure storage
facilities may require approval in accordance with Section 9 of the
Environmental Protection Act. The Application should be forwarded to the
Environmental Impact Assessment Section, Department of Technology &
Environment. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> will be consulted on all new and expanded
livestock operations. New or major expansions to commercial livestock
operations require an Environmental Review Document. The complexity of the
Environmental Review Document may vary depending on the size and nature of the
proposed project and on surrounding land uses. The Environmental Review
Document is expected to: * give a detailed description of the project and the
existing environment, * identify positive impacts of proposal and describe ways
of minimizing the risk of negative impacts, if any, * address groundwater and
surface water concerns, * outline a manure management plan including land
application and nutrient utilization, * outline an odour management plan, *
identify impacts on surrounding land uses, if any, and describe mitigation
plans, * outline waste water disposal plans (milk house waste water, washrooms,
etc.) * outline a solid waste management plan including dead stock, plastics,
feed bags, etc. Providing notification and information to the public is an
integral part of the environmental impact assessment and approval process and
an appropriate level of public information should be included in all
assessments depending on the size and nature of the undertaking and the
complexity of surrounding land uses. It is strongly recommended that once a
proponent has carefully planned his/her new or expanded commercial livestock
operation and has considered the environmental and community related issues in
the surrounding area, that they initiate communication with neighboring
residents and businesses. In order to avoid the spreading of inaccurate
information that can raise unnecessary concerns or false expectations, it is
vital that the community be advised at an early stage in the planning process.
It is understood that you may not be able to satisfy everyone's wishes but you
will satisfy most people through the information sessions. *For commercial
livestock development proposals,* *the occupied residences and businesses in
the surrounding community (a radius of 1 km is a useful guide) should be
notified.* Public information sessions are a valuable public information tool
and are recommended A written description of the project should be distributed
to the community. The project description should include relevant information
from the environmental review document related to manure storage and handling,
odour control, surface water control, manure spreading plans, steps to be taken
to protect groundwater and surface water, and such other information as may be
appropriate. Where a public information session is held, it can take the form
of an open house at the proponent's residence or on the site of the project.
Representatives from the Department of Technology and Environment & the
Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> will be in attendance and will receive concerns
either verbally at the session or in writing within a reasonable period of
time. Another alternative is to visit neighbours to explain the project and
receive comments on the project, including informing them of the opportunity to
provide written comments to the Department of Technology and Environment. These
written comments and /or concerns will be forwarded to the Minister for
consideration concerning the approval of the project and for the placement of
conditions deemed necessary for the protection of the environment or to reduce
the impact of the operation on other residents or occupiers of the community.
If the proposed operation complies with the guidelines, the livestock operation
can expect to receive approval. It should be understood that the environmental
approval process recognizes that Prince Edward Island is primariily a rural
agricultural province and that livestock operations have a right to establish,
expand and operate in accordance with reasonable, environmentally acceptable
and economically sustainable management practices. At the same time the process
does consider the needs and concerns of other residents of the community and
should provide assurance that they can continue to enjoy a good quality of life
in rural areas of P.E.I. *Published jointly by: P.E.I. Department of

php3?number=70588</=E> / 7. Siting to Reduce Odour Nuisance *7.1 Minimum
Separation Distance (MSD) Method* This section deals with the recommended
minimum separation distances between livestock barns and manure storages and
other non-agricultural uses. Separation between livestock facilities and
neighbours are intended to compensate for normal odour production, thereby
reducing potential conflicts. An appropriate separation distance in a rural
area will vary with the nature of the odour source as well as the sensitivity
to those odours by the neighbouring land use. As a general rule where the
majority of residents and businesses within the minimum separation distance
(MSD) are in agreement with the *new livestock operation*, the MSD requirements
could be varied. Where residences and businesses currently exist within the
minimum separation distance of an *expanding livestock operation*, the Minimum
Separation Distance (MSD) does not apply. The owner of that operation can
expect to receive approval to expand provided the operation complies with all
other requirements of these guidelines and other relevant land use and
environmental protection legislation. The views of residents and businesses
that are within the MSD of an expanding farm operation will be given due
consideration during the review process. *7.2 Application of Minimum Separation
Distance (MSD) in Land Use Planning.* The Minimum Separation Distance is an
important planning tool for government agencies and municipalities.
Municipalities should, as part of their development policies, require that the
minimum distances obtained from the tables be considered in the siting of
livestock operations. *The Minimum Separation Distances shall be applied to all
new livestock facilities, and/or change of use of a livestock facility, and
should be considered in expanding livestock operations locating in the rural
area. * *All development permits issued in a rural area by the Province must
include the following statement: "This permit has been issued in a geographic
area that does not have land use zoning. The area may include existing or
future residential, agriculture, commercial, industrial, forestry, tourism,
fishing, aquaculture or institutional uses which may influence the use of the
site for which the permit has been issued".* *7.3 Implementation of Minimum
Separation Distance (MSD)* * The applicant completes the MSD Data Sheet and
Sketch Sheet and submits them to the appropriate building permit office
(municipal or Provincial government) for determination of separation distances
and to initiate the building permit process. * The Department of Agriculture
and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> will be consulted and provide recommendations on
permit applications involving commercial livestock operations. * MSD applies
when an application is made for a new livestock facility or change of use of a
livestock facility. * MSD applies only to livestock and poultry facilities. It
is not used to calculate separation distances from uses such as kennels,
apiaries, greenhouses, mushroom farms, stockyards, assembly yards, or
slaughterhouses. * MSD shall apply to all dwellings, institutions, commercial
or industrial establishments and other types of buildings that may be used or
occupied by people. * The direction of the prevailing winds, the presence of
berms or other forms of screening do not affect the calculated MSD. * The
minimum separation distance may be reduced by up to 25% if prevailing summer
winds are favorable to reducing odour nuisance. * Further variances to the MSD
may be considered based on site specific circumstances. * Provincial officials
must consult P.E.I. Department of Agriculture and Forestry
www.gov.pe.ca/af/index.php3> staff when considering a variance application.
Conditions that meet the intent, if not the precise distance of MSD, or that
mitigate environmental impacts, will receive further consideration. Such
conditions may include unique topography and/or micro-climate which mitigate
nuisance, visual screening and unique management/technology. * Distance to the
neighbouring buildings is measured as the shortest distance between that
portion of the assessed barn used for livestock housing or the manure storage
and the neighbouring buildings. * Distance to zoned areas is measured as the
shortest distance between the part of the barn occupied by livestock or manure
storage and the nearest zone boundary. * Distances to the nearest side lot
line, rear lot line, and nearest road allowance are measured between the
closest point of the part of the barn occupied by livestock or manure storage
and the lot line or road allowance. * MSD does not apply to the dwelling(s)
owned by the owner of the new or expanding livestock operation. The Minimum
Separation Distance Data Sheet
