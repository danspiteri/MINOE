22 ((11))The purpose of this Act is to provide for the protection, designation,
recovery and other relevant aspects of conservation of species at risk in the
Province, including habitat protection, while recognizing the following:
(a) the goal of preventing any species in the Province from becoming extirpated
or extinct as a consequence of human activities;
(b) the conservation of species at risk is a key component of a broader
strategy to maintain biodiversity and to use biological resources in a
sustainable manner;
(c) the commitment of Government to a national co-operative approach for the
conservation of species at risk, as agreed to in the National Accord for the
Protection of Species at Risk;
(d) all Nova Scotians share responsibility for the conservation of species at
risk and governments have a leadership role to play in this regard;
(e) Nova Scotians be provided with the opportunity for meaningful participation
in relation to conservation of species at risk;
(f) the aboriginal peoples of the Province have an important role in conserving
species at risk;
(g) the importance of promoting the purposes of this Act primarily through non-
regulatory means such as co-operation, stewardship, education and partnerships
instead of punitive measures, including such preventative actions as education,
incentives, sustainable management practices and integrated resource
management; and
(h) the precautionary principle that a lack of full scientific certainty must
not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize the threat
of a species at risk in the Province.
((22))For greater certainty, nothing in this Act shall be construed so as to
abrogate or derogate from the protection provided for existing aboriginal or
treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada by the recognition and

habitat of an endangered, threatened or vulnerable species for purposes of
encouraging and assisting in the stewardship and management of the habitat or
the core habitat for the recovery or maintenance of the species.
((22))In addition to subsection (1), where the Minister considers it necessary for
the purpose of implementing a recovery plan, the Minister may designate
specific physical areas or landforms of the Province as core habitat.
((33))Core habitat shall not include the entire geographical range that can be
occupied by the threatened or endangered species unless inclusion is considered
essential for the survival of the species.
((44))The Minister may designate core habitat on private lands only where the
Minister is satisfied that the core habitat of the endangered or threatened
species on public lands is not sufficient to meet the recovery needs of the
species.
((55))The Minister may make regulations respecting all or any specific core
habitat for the purpose of controlling, restricting or prohibiting any use of,
access to, activity on or the release of any substances on or in the core
habitat for such period as considered necessary.

the lands when the use is prohibited,
the Minister shall compensate the owner of the private lands for the loss
imposed upon that use.
((88))Compensation under subsection (7) may be in any form agreed to by the
Minister and the owner.
((99))Where the Minister and the owner cannot agree on the value of compensation,
the question of value may, at the option of the owner, be referred to the
Utility and Review Board and the provisions of Chapter 156 of the Revised
Statutes, 1989, the EExxpprroopprriiaattiioonn AAcctt, shall apply mmuuttaattiiss mmuuttaannddiiss to the
