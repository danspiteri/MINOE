2 The purpose of this Act is to support and promote the protection, enhancement
and prudent use of the environment while recognizing the following goals:
(a) maintaining environmental protection as essential to the integrity of
ecosystems, human health and the socio-economic well-being of society;
(b) maintaining the principles of sustainable development, including
    * (i) the principle of ecological value, ensuring the maintenance and
      restoration of essential ecological processes and the preservation and
      prevention of loss of biological diversity,
(ii) the precautionary principle will be used in decision-making so that where
there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the lack of full
scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing measures to
prevent environmental degradation,
(iii) the principle of pollution prevention and waste reduction as the
foundation for long-term environmental protection, including
    * (A) the conservation and efficient use of resources,
(B) the promotion of the development and use of sustainable, scientific and
technological innovations and management systems, and
(C) the importance of reducing, reusing, recycling and recovering the products
of our society,
(iv) the principle of shared responsibility of all Nova Scotians to sustain the
environment and the economy, both locally and globally, through individual and
government actions,
(v) the stewardship principle, which recognizes the responsibility of a
producer for a product from the point of manufacturing to the point of final
disposal,
(vi) the linkage between economic and environmental issues, recognizing that
long-term economic prosperity depends upon sound environmental management and
that effective environmental protection depends on a strong economy, and
(vii) the comprehensive integration of sustainable development principles in
public policy making in the Province;
(c) the polluter-pay principle confirming the responsibility of anyone who
creates an adverse effect on the environment that is not de minimis to take
remedial action and pay for the costs of that action;
(d) taking remedial action and providing for rehabilitation to restore an
adversely affected area to a beneficial use;
(e) Government having a catalyst role in the areas of environmental education,
environmental management, environmental emergencies, environmental research and
the development of policies, standards, objectives and guidelines and other
measures to protect the environment;
(f) encouraging the development and use of environmental technologies,
innovations and industries;
(g) the Province being responsible for working co-operatively and building
partnerships with other provinces, the Government of Canada, other governments
and other persons respecting transboundary matters and the co-ordination of
legislative and regulatory initiatives;
(h) providing access to information and facilitating effective public
participation in the formulation of decisions affecting the environment,
including opportunities to participate in the review of legislation,
regulations and policies and the provision of access to information affecting
the environment;
(i) providing a responsive, effective, fair, timely and efficient
administrative and regulatory system, recognizing that wherever practical, it
is essential to promote the purpose of this Act primarily through non-
regulatory means such as co-operation, communication, education, incentives and
partnerships, instead of punitive measures. 11999944--9955,, cc.. 11,, ss.. 22;; 22000066,, cc.. 3300,,

administration of this Act for the inspector to do anything set out in Section
119; and

(ii) whether the person knew or ought reasonably to have known that the
substance was present over, in, on or under the site at the time that person
became an owner, occupier or operator,
(iii) whether the presence of the substance over, in, on or under the site
ought to have been discovered by the owner, occupier or operator had the owner,
occupier or operator exercised due diligence in ascertaining the presence of
the substance before the owner, occupier or operator became an owner, occupier
or operator, and whether the owner, occupier or operator exercised such due
diligence,
(iv) whether the presence of the substance over, in, on or under the site was
caused solely by the act or omission of an independent third party,
(v) the economic benefits the person may have received and the relationship
between that price and the fair market value of the site had the substance not
been present over, in, on or under it;
(c) in the case of a previous owner, occupier or operator whether that person
disposed of the interest in the site without disclosing the presence of the
substance over, in, on or under the site to the person who acquired the
interest;
(d) whether the person took all reasonable care to prevent the presence of the
substance over, in, on or under the site;
(e) whether a person dealing with the substance ignored industry standards and
practices in effect at the time or complied with the requirements of applicable
enactments in effect at the time;
(f) whether the person contributed to further accumulation or the continued
release of the substance on becoming aware of the presence of the substance
over, in, on or under the site;

presence of the substance over, in, on or under the site;

165 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other enactment
respecting the protection or rehabilitation of the environment, receivers,
receiver managers, trustees, executors or administrators of a person
responsible, and their agents and employees, are not responsible for the
rehabilitation of a contaminated site under any such provision beyond the value
of the assets the persons are administering less the reasonable costs and fees
of the administration, in relation to their position as receiver, receiver
manager, trustee, executor or administrator of the assets of a person
responsible, in respect of any adverse effect that occurred
(a) before the appointment of the receiver, receiver-manager, executor,
administrator or trustee; or
(b) after appointment, except where the adverse effect occurred as a result of
the failure of the receiver, receiver manager, trustee, executor or
administrator to exercise due diligence.
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who had care, management or
control, in whole or in part, of the site at the time the adverse effect
occurred or imposed requirements on any person regarding the manner of
treatment, disposal or handling of a substance and the control or requirements,
in whole or in part, caused the site to become a contaminated site.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other enactment, a
secured creditor is responsible for rehabilitation at a contaminated site if
(a) the secured creditor at any time exercised care, management or control, in
whole or in part, of the site or imposed requirements on any person regarding
the manner of treatment, disposal or handling of a substance and the care,
management or control or requirements, in whole or in part, caused the site to
become a contaminated site; or
(b) subject to subsection (4), the secured creditor becomes the registered
owner of the real property at the contaminated site unless an agreement is
entered into pursuant to Section 89,
but a secured creditor is not responsible for rehabilitation where it acts
primarily to protect its security interest, including, without restricting the
generality of the foregoing, where the secured creditor
(c) participates only in purely financial matters related to the site;
(d) has the capacity or ability to influence any operation at the contaminated
site in a way that would have the effect of causing or increasing
contamination, but does not exercise that capacity or ability in such a way as
to cause or increase contamination;
(e) imposes requirements on any person if the requirements do not have a
reasonable probability of causing or increasing contamination at the site; or
(f) appoints a person to inspect or investigate a contaminated site to
determine future steps or actions that the secured creditor might take.
(4) Notwithstanding clause 3(b), a secured creditor is not responsible for the
rehabilitation of a contaminated site beyond the value of the assets the
secured creditor is administering.
(5) Nothing in this Section exempts a secured creditor, receiver, receiver
manager, trustee, executor or administrator from any duty to report or make
disclosure imposed by a provision of this Act. 11999944--9955,, cc.. 11,, ss.. 116655..
