            (4)    If requested by a development officer, the Department
     must send a written response to the development officer, and copy it
     to the subdivider, respecting the assessment report on the
     suitability of the lot being subdivided to support a system that
     indicates one of the following:
      
                     (a)    that the information provided by the
     subdivider is insufficient to allow the Department to determine
     whether the lot is suitable for the proposed system and that the
     subdivider must provide additional information;
      
                     (b)    that the lot is suitable for the proposed
     system and specifying any terms and conditions that must be met;

     system and specifying the reasons for this determination.
      
            (5)    A written response made by the Department under
     subsection (4) is deemed to be based on the physical conditions of
     the lot being subdivided and the abutting properties at the time of
     the assessment report, and any change in the conditions since the
     time of the assessment report may nullify any determination by the
     Department that the lot is suitable.
