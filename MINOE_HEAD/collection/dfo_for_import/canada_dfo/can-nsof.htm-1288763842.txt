remains unpaid, direct the Board to
(a) refuse to issue to that person any interest in relation to any portion of
the offshore area;
(b) refuse to authorize, pursuant to clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section
135, that person to carry on any work or activity related to the exploration
for or the production of petroleum on any portion of the offshore area and may
suspend any such authorization already given; and

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a decision of the Board
made in accordance with a direction of the Minister pursuant to subsection (3)

within part of a field or pool or the operating of any well that, having regard
to sound engineering and economic principles, results or tends to result in a
reduction in the quantity of petroleum ultimately recoverable from a pool;
(c) the drilling, equipping, completing, operating or producing of any well in
a manner that causes or is likely to cause the unnecessary or excessive loss or
destruction of petroleum after removal from the reservoir;
(d) the inefficient storage of petroleum above ground or underground;
(e) the production of petroleum in excess of available storage, transportation
or marketing facilities;
(f) the escape or flaring of gas that could be economically recovered and
processed or economically injected into an underground reservoir; or
(g) the failure to use suitable artificial, secondary or supplementary recovery
methods in a pool when it appears that such methods would result in increasing
the quantity of petroleum, ultimately recoverable under sound engineering and
economic principles. 11998877,, cc.. 33,, ss.. 115511..

 (All latitudes and longitudes referred to in this Schedule
are determined according to N.A.D. 27 datum.)
 The inner limit of the offshore area is the low water mark of Nova Scotia,
except that
 (a) in the vicinity of Chignecto Bay, the inner limit is a straight line from
the most southwesterly point on the most northwesterly point on the low water
mark at Cape Chignecto (N.S.) to a point at latitude 45 24' 10" and longitude
65 03' 31", being on a line between that point at Cape Chignecto (N.S.) and
Martin Head (N.B.);
 (b) in the vicinity of Minas Channel, the inner limit is a straight line from
the most southwesterly point on the low water mark at Cape Chignecto (N.S.) to
the most northwesterly point on the low water mark at Long Point (N.S.);
 (c) in the vicinity of St. Mary's Bay, the inner limit is a straight line from
the most southerly point on the low water mark at Long Island (N.S.) to the low
water mark at the nearest point on the mainland, being approximately two
kilometres southwesterly of Meteghan (N.S.);
 (d) in the vicinity of Chedabucto Bay, the inner limit is a straight line from
the most easterly point on the low water mark at Glasgow Head (N.S.) to the
most southwesterly point on the low water mark at Red Point (N.S.);
 (e) in the vicinity of St. George's Bay, the inner limit is a straight line
from the most easterly point on the low water mark at Cape George Point (N.S.)
to the most westerly point on the low water mark at McKays Point (N.S.); and
 (f) in any bay where a straight closing line of ten kilometres or less may be
drawn between points on the low water mark of the bay so that the area of the
bay landward of the closing line is greater than that of a semi-circle whose
diameter is the closing line, the inner limit is the closing line; and for the
purposes of this paragraph,
    * (i) "bay" includes harbour, port, cove, sound, channel, basin or other
      inlet,
 (ii) the closing line shall be drawn in such manner as to enclose a maximum
area of the bay, and
 (iii) the area of the bay shall be calculated as including any islands or
parts of islands lying landward of the closing line and as excluding any area
above the low water mark along the coast of the bay.
